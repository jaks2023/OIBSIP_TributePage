          <h2 class="topic">The Iron Man of India</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the iron man of India, was born on October 31, 1875, in Nadiad, Kheda district of Gujarat. He was a successful barrister, a Senior Congress leader and one of the prominent figures of India’s freedom struggle movement.
            <p> A staunch congressman, the first deputy Prime Minister of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai was a true Gandhian who was committed to the unity and integrity of India. He played an exemplary role in the integration of 565 princely states to the union of India and was proudly regarded as the Iron Man of India. Recently, Sardar Patel, in a very calculated and fabricated manner, was projected to be anti-Nehru and a seamless campaign was unleashed to project Pt. Nehru as his adversary.</p>
            <p> But the history says otherwise, both Pt. Nehru and Sardar Patel were the right and the left hands of the Congress Party and their commitment to democracy, secularism and integrity of the country was unparalleled. In the current situation when the ‘idea of India’ is under fierce attack and a charged communal environment is hovering over the country; imposing threat to the integrity of the country. The farmers have been protesting the three contentious farm laws and the government is least bothered to talk to them; let alone solving the problems of the farmers. </p>
        <p> life and principles of Sarder Patel become pertinent in this environment of hatred and insensitivity against which he stood firmly and vehemently throughout his life. After completing his education in England, he returned to India and settled in Ahmedabad and became one of the city’s most successful barristers. He was not keen to join add politics at the early stages of his life but his meeting with Mahatma Gandhi in 1917 in Godhra changed his life fundamentally.</p>
        <p>On Gandhi’s call, Patel quit his hard-earned job, joined the Congress party and joined the movement to fight for exemption of taxes in Kheda at the time of plague and famine (1918). During the Non-Cooperation Movement (1920), he actively participated and recruited 3 lakh volunteers to the Congress Party and collected a sum of Rs. 1.5 million for party fund. When Gandhi ji was imprisoned in 1923, it was Sardar Patel who led the Satyagraha against the British law of banning the hoisting of India’s flag.

          <p>
        The Statue of Unity is a monument dedicated to Patel, located in the Indian state of Gujarat, facing the Narmada Dam, 3.2 km away from Sadhu Bet near Vadodara. At the height of 182 metres (597 feet), it is the world's tallest statue, exceeding the Spring Temple Buddha by 54 meters. This statue and related structures are spread over 20,000 square meters and are surrounded by an artificial lake spread across 12 km and cost an estimated 29.8 billion rupees ($425m). It was inaugurated by India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 31 October 2018, the 143rd anniversary of Patel's birth. The height of the statue in meters has been picked to match the total assembly constituencies in Gujarat.</p>
